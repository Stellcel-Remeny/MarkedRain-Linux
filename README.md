# Tip

**Use `--depth 1` when using `git clone`, because the actual size of this repo is ~50mb. Without it, you will clone like *~200mb*! If you care about internet bandwidth or speed, clone like this (an example):**

```git clone https://github.com/NTSP3/MarkedRain.git --depth=1```

# "MarkedRain" Operating System

![Logogram](media/Logograms/Full.png)

The "MarkedRain" is a new linux OS that uses buildroot with OpenRC as init. It is really easy to work with. There was an older system based on Os2020, but working with nothing proved difficult.

## Showcase

## Compiling

Install dependencies for 'make' & 'menuconfig', then run "make menuconfig". Configure as per you desire, then you can either do "make" on the root directory, or go to "source/buildroot" and run menuconfig there, to configure its options, and then run "make" on the root directory, not on buildroot's directory.

View "docs/building.md" for other make options.

## Goals & Future plans!

Here's where I put some plans for the OS.
- Goal: Easy to use OS for windows users looking to switch to linux
- Be lightweight.
- Add a PE installer (bootable) & an installer.exe (for windows users)
- Make the installer an interactive Ren'Py game (for beginners), and a Windows XP TUI-style setup (for advanced users)
- Try to make the user feel at ease
- Excellent compatibility with Windows apps (maybe run a tiny windows along with the OS?)
